You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Developing

If using VSCode/Cursor, remember to install the Prettier extension so that format on save is enabled.

System level components should be put under `app/system`, while page level components can be put under
`_components` of that page folder.
